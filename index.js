 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 * 
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 * 
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

/* Task 1: `counterMaker`
 * Study the code for counter1 and counter2. Answer the questions below.
 * 
 * 1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
 * 
 * Counter1 uses two functions in order to use counter1 you'd use counterMaker(parameter) to use counter2 you
 * could simply call counter2() but count needs to be set beforehand.
 * 
 * 2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
 * 
 * Counter1 uses a closure it uses a parent element to set the variable, and child function to increment it.
 * 
 * 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better? 
 * 
 * counter2 will be better if you need to manipulate the count variable. Counter1 is better if you need to set
 * multiple scores at once.
